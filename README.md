Welcome guys to my CodeFightClub Project, here's the breif information about this project and how you can contribute. Thanks.

# ⚔️ CodeFightClub (CFC)

CodeFightClub is a competitive coding arena where developers battle each other in real time.
Pick a category, get matched with an opponent from anywhere in the world, solve the same problem, and prove who’s faster and sharper.

Yes, you got that right, this is is developer vs developer.

## 🧠 What is CFC?
CodeFightClub is an online platform built for developers who want to compete, learn, and improve through real-time coding battles.

How it works:

-> Authenticate yourself
-> Select a coding category (DSA, Problem Solving, Logic, Algorithms)
-> Enter matchmaking
-> Get matched with another developer in the same category
-> Both players receive the same coding question
-> Write and submit your solution
-> The first correct solution wins 🏆

Once a match ends:

The winner is announced instantly
The opponent is notified

You can either:

- Continue solving for practice, or
- Leave and start a new match
